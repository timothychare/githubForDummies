Branching is an effective way to prevent conflicts between miltiple developers and features.

Another common way to use branching is to have each feature that you develop be on a different branch, regardless of the collaborator who is building the feature.

You can extend the idea of branching by feature to also have one branch that is your production branch. This branch is what your users will see. Then you can have a development branch, which is one that you can merge features into without changing what your users see.

This type of branching allows you to build a lot of different features, merge them each into the development branch, make sure they all work the way you want, and then merge the development branch into the production
